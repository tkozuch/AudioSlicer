# AudioSlicer

Audio Slicer is a web application for slicing audio files according to information given in 
form of text.

## Demo

Demo of application is available on https://audio-slicer.herokuapp.com/ 

(Due to Heroku's 30s max request time policy, the above demo may work only on small files. 
Was tested there on a test file of size ~500kB: `AudioSlicer/slicing_app/tests/test_ablum_shorter
.mp3`.)

## Usage example

An example input (inserted in the UI):
```
title:                          time:
1. You Love Me - ye ye ye       0:00
2. My second song               3:40
3. I Love You                   7:20
```

This will result in input file being sliced into 3 files:
```
"1. You Love me - ye ye ye.mp3"   (00:00-3:40 of the input file)
"2. My second song.mp3"           (3:40-7:20 of the input file)
"3. I love you.mp3"               (7:20 -> the end of the input file)
```

During the process a real-time progress bar is displayed and the files are ready for download afterwards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:

Get repository:

`git clone https://github.com/tkozuch/AudioSlicer.git`

Past .env file:
(For the project to fully work you will need to ask developer about `.env` file with environmental variables.)

When acquired place the file in project folder (`AudioSlicer`)

All required ENV_VARIABLES:
```
S3_BUCKET
SECRET_KEY
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
CELERY_BROKER_URL
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND
PYTHONUNBUFFERED
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
C_FORCE_ROOT
RUNNING_ON_HEROKU
DEBUG
```

## Start with docker:

Having Docker installed on your computer, go into project folder and execute:
<br>`docker-compose build`
<br>`docker-compose up`

Wait after requirements are downloaded, built and up-and-running.
 
(After build, starting of application should take around 1 minute. Usually the process is  finished
 when the logging to console stops with `[...]celery@xxx ready.` message.)
