# AudioSlicer

Audio Slicer is a web application for slicing audio files according to information given in form of text. 
A typical usage example includes slicing live concert record or album to individual songs. 
User gives only two information inputs: text informing about titles and cuts, and a file. 

An example input would being:
```
1. You Love Me - ye ye ye 0:00
2. My second song 3:40
3. I Love You 7:20
```

Will result in input file being sliced into 3 files:
```
"1. You Love me - ye ye ye.mp3" (00:00-3:40 of the input file)
"2. My second song.mp3" (3:40-7:20 of the input file)
"3. I love you.mp3" (7:20 -> the end of the input file)
```

During the process a real-time progress bar is displayed and the files are ready for download afterwards.
